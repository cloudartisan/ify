WHAT, WHY

The interfaces in UseCase.idl represent a first cut attempt to provide interfaces for
the functionality described in the Market Information Requirements 0.7 document 
for requirements
"5.2  Code Lookup", "5.3 Research Security / Company" and 
"5.4 User Researches An Overseas Share Market". 

At the time of our contract's termination, we were in the process of defining interfaces
for the functionality we would provide to other teams within the group.
It was intended that we would
discuss these interfaces with the team that would be using
these interfaces and refine them over time.

They've been reviewed by CommSecure, but the team that would be using
these interfaces hasn't been consulted. The interfaces were still incomplete
at the time of our termination.
